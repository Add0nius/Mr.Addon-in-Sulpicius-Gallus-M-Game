Use the elements, ice, fire, teleportation portals and solve the “sharp” puzzles of this adventure, while you enjoy viewing the pictorial work of Peláez Ochoa and the musical work of unTIL BEN.

Regarding the gameplay, MrAddon is an incredible 2D platform game, whose mechanics consists of eliminating all the enemies in each level, as well as a boss that is at the end of each world for 3 worlds. Being able to play in an "Arcade" mode or in the "Level Selection" mode. The game cannot be saved and the "continues" are limited. The difficulty increases as the game progresses, mainly due to the dangerousness of the enemies and the structure of the screen, where many times you have to find out the best way to solve the level. To eliminate all the enemies of the level, it is achieved by throwing them multi-frequency "rainbow" rays, which is the special ability of the MrAddon character, thus turning them into "Moons", "Snow balls" or "Fire balls" and then rolling them to eliminate more enemies. An adventure created by fans of the mythical Arcade game Snow Bros.
